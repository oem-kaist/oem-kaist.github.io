						Metamaterials
					</span>
					<p class = 'article'>
						metamaterial is a material which gains its properties from its structure rather than directly from its composition. Metamaterial is a conceptual breakthrough that emerged less than a decade ago, and now the field of metamaterials have exploded in the last few years.  Recently, researchers have demonstrated fishnet-type 3D bulk metamaterials having negative index of refraction at optical frequency that bends the light in the wrong direction.  Our group will investigate unexplored functionalities that only the metamaterial can provide and we will search for new application areas of metamaterials.

					<p class = 'article'>
						Ultrahigh-Q whispering-gallery cavity is an ideal template to study the mechanical oscillation or cooling of a cantilever-like dielectric structure.  The underlying mechanism of this mechanical oscillation or cooling is originated from the radiation pressure of confined photons inside the cavity, which exerts an outward force on the cavity wall.  This is a newly developed area of research and this research renders vast opportunities for the applications of photon-induced mechanical oscillators (> 1 GHz) or the cooling of the cavity to effective cryogenic temperatures by dynamic back-action.  Even more interestingly, it is now anticipated that the quantum behavior of a macroscopic object will be attainable with further advances in this cooling technique.

						Plasmonics
					</span>
					<p class = 'article'>
						Surface plasmon-polariton (collective electron density wave) propagating along the interface of two materials having oppositely-signed permittivities is now being widely exploited to enable subwavelength-scale functional optical devices owing to its highly localized electromagnetic energy density profiles.  However, a fundamental bottleneck for the realization of SPP nano-optical functional devices stems from large metal loss at optical frequencies induced by ohmic resistive heating.  Hence, any type of plasmonic resonator based on a plasmonic waveguiding principle is mostly limited by the metal loss in addition to other sources of loss contributions such as roughness-induced scattering, radiation into free space/substrate or bending-induced radiation.  While other types of plasmonic cavities can be built, whispering-gallery resonances, which are also found for various types of travelling waves in axisymmetric resonant structures, are especially attractive due to their extremely high reflectivity.
